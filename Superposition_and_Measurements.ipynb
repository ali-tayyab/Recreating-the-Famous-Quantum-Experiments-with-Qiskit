    "### **Superposition, Interference and Measurement**\n",
    "Superposition and measurement are two core concepts in quantum computing. If we start from very basic, unlike classical bits quantum bits or qubits behaves like it is in state 0 and 1 at the same time. This is because a qubit is in superposition where it can be in its all possible states, until we observe it. When we measure a qubit, the wavefunction collapse into one of the basis state : $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$. One of the most famous experiment demonstrating these concepts is the **double-slit experiment**. In this notebook, we'll see the behavior of particles when passed through detector with or without the presence of detector. The famous **Schrodinger's Cat Experiment** is also that strange as the behavior of particles when they pass through slits."
